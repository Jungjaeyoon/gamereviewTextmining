I pre ordered this game weeks in advance because I am a if fan of the fallout series. I enjoyed Fallout 3 and yes even New Vegas.  I couldn't wait to sit down for hours and tell everyone how good this game is...alas it isn't so.\\r The graphics for one are mediocre at best with game such as witcher 3 and assassins creed pushing the envelope. There is no excuse for this at all. Honestly it's comparable to the graphics in Fallout 3\\r The story, I know how could they screw this part up. This is what I was like looking forward to the most.  They were very lazy in putting the story together. There is no back story or time to get in to the character which is a staple with fallout games.  The reviewers say they throw you in to the story.  I say they were lazy plain and simple.  The result is I don't care about the character or his journey.\\r The gameplay smh. It just isn't fun.  There is no yes moment when you kill your last enemy or go through the dialogue which is all bad.  The main character sounds like he is one word away from going straight to sleep.\\r In the end I am very disappointed.  Bethesda had enough time to knock this out the park but gave us something that feels unfinished . I read through the positive reviews no and I understand people want to like this game honestly I get that. As gamers though we can't settle for mediocrity lets reward companies who push the envelope and berate those who give us slop.  This is the first game I ever preordered and I'm honestly amazed at how mediocre it is.  I would rent it first if you like it then buy.  Shame on Bethesda though for releasing this knowing it was half crap.… Expand\"]]"
